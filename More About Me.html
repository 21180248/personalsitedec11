      Let's Go In Detail
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br> When I graduate I plan to major in culinary arts through trade school. 	Eventually I will go to a community college or a university (who knows) and minor in social work. </br>
I am very heavy minded when it comes to education or anything that has to do with success because all hard times leads to success. When I was 2 I was adopted, so I never knew my biological parents, so when I hear other kids my age have harder situations than me it pushes me because one day I want to fight for those who just canâ€™t fight no more.
